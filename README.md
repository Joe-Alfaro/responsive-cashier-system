This place needs some serious help. They are getting rid of all their cash registers and replacing all of them with some cheap iPads they got a hold of (screen size 1024x768) and the employees will have iPhone 5's (screen size 320x568) that they can use to checkout customer's when the lines get too long. They need a screen layout for both devices and the employees have a request, "Please don't let it be as ugly as it was".

So...
-Responsive
-All of the previous funcionality
-Beautiful

Oh and we need it done yesterday, thanks!
