# Responsive Cashier System

This place needs some serious help. They are getting rid of all their cash registers and replacing all of them with some cheap iPads they got a hold of (screen size 1024x768) and the employees will have iPhone 5's (screen size 320x568) that they can use to checkout customer's when the lines get too long. It would be nice if you could roll out the mobile version first because then we can start using those with our current registers while you finish up the iPad version. They need a screen layout for both devices and the employees have a request, "Please don't let it be as ugly as it was".

So...

-Responsive

-All of the previous funcionality

-Mobile first

-Beautiful

Oh and we need it done yesterday, thanks!

From the boss: "We are phasing out vanilla CSS company wide and are only going to be compiled CSS, so all styles should be transferred to preprocessing. Because I'm the boss I also decided the preprocessor we will be using will be LESS. Thank you". Bosses, what are you going do right?
